## Types of accounts:

### Admin:

Admins will be in charge of the entire library management system.

The features of admins:

1. Investigate other users, create accounts for teachers, delete specific user accounts, respond to and solve problems for other users, and examine user reports and replying to then if needed.
2. Update and categorize the database (removing or adding a book, changing the status of a book).
3. Send emails to users about books they've requested, deadlines, and how to pay the fine.
4. Issue books to the user if the book is available. They control the book issuing and updating of the availabilities of books.
5. Also, admins upload the first few pages of available hard copies with necessary information. In the case of soft copies, they can upload the whole book.
6. Managing the list of issued books

### Users:

Both teachers and students can be users. We can identify the type of user by **_badges_**.

The features of users:

1. Make changes to their accounts.
2. Search or see other user profiles.
3. They'll have a profile that includes a list of books they've rented and returned. It provides the user's history of contribution and participation.
4. In the case of issuing books, the librarians provide hard copies. So, users can go through the short pdfs uploaded by the admins and get an overview.
5. Conduct with admins. They can search, request, recommend, or even report on books or other users.
6. If the users want to borrow the hard copies, they'll have to get the hard copies from the administration later.
7. They can download soft copies(if available) from the library.

### An Extra Feature To Fulfil The Aim of Unilib

It is not just a conduct system between users and libraries. It is more than that. To make it more flexible for users, we introduced **Forum**. It is free from the admin's supervision.

Features of Forum:

1. Users can search for books by title and author.
2. They can share notes, books, research papers with users. They can delete books uploaded by them.
3. They can download the pdfs from the library.
4. They are free to discuss their academic issues. They can search or delete posts.

We tried our best to implement all the features perfectly. In the end, Unilib is a user-friendly library and resource management system. It assembles a swift media for academic help for both students and teachers.
